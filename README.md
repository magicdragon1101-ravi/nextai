## ðŸ”¨ Problem
If you've ever fallen in love with Next.JS like I did last year, you probably understand the excitement it brings to web development. The documentation is comprehensive, informative, and well-written, but I encountered a challenge - there was no quick and easy way to ask questions and get answers with the latest information using AI chats.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution
To address this issue, I embarked on a mission to combine the power of OpenAI APIs with the open access to Next.JS documentation.

## âœ¨ Introducing "Next AI"
Next AI is your go-to companion for all things Next.JS. You can now ask any questions related to Next.JS with the confidence of the official documentation. To ensure the information is always up to date, a cron job runs daily to refresh the data.

### âœ¦ Made with love by Enzo âœ¦
I am passionate about Next.JS and excited to share this project with fellow developers. Next AI is a product of love and dedication to the dev community.

Feel free to explore NextAI and give any suggestions!
