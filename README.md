## üî® Problem
If you've ever fallen in love with Next.js like I did last year, you probably understand the excitement it brings to web development. The documentation is comprehensive, informative, and well-written, but I encountered a challenge - there was no quick and easy way to ask questions and get answers with the latest information using AI chats.

## üí° Solution
To address this issue, I embarked on a mission to combine the power of OpenAI APIs with the open access to Next.js documentation.

## ‚ú® Introducing "Next AI"
Next AI is your go-to companion for all things Next.js. You can now ask any questions related to Next.js with the confidence of the official documentation. To ensure the information is always up to date, a cron job runs daily to refresh the data.

## üñ≤Ô∏è Technologies 
Next.js 13 + Tailwind + Supabase + OpenAI API 

### ‚ú¶ Made with love by Enzo ‚ú¶
I am passionate about Next.js and excited to share this project with fellow developers. NextAI is a product of love and dedication to the dev community.

Feel free to explore NextAI and give any suggestions!
